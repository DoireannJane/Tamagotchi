# Tamagotchi

User will open the default browser and be presented with an egg. Clicking on the egg will cause an alert to appear that the egg has been hatched. A prompt will ask for a name to call their baby pet. The name will appear above. Periodically the baby pet will get hungry, want to play or want to sleep. The baby pet will get older as time goes on and die sooner without food, play or sleep.
